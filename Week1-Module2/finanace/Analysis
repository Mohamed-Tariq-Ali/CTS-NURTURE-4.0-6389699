The recursive approach to financial forecasting has O(n) time and space complexity due to the recursive function calls.

By using Memoization, we can avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency in cases where subproblems repeat.

For simple problems like this one, an iterative approach might often be more efficient than recursion, particularly if recursion depth is large.
